The **OnsideKit SDK** allows you to seamlessly integrate in-app purchases and subscriptions into your applications. It handles the entire payment flow, providing a secure and reliable experience for your users while simplifying the implementation process for you.

## Features
*   **‚ú® Familiar StoreKit-like API**: Designed to be highly similar to Apple's native StoreKit framework, ensuring a minimal learning curve for experienced iOS developers.
*   **üí≥ Multiple Payment Methods**: Securely process payments via **Apple Pay** and **Bank Cards**.
*   **üîÑ Unified Purchase Flow**: A single, streamlined process for handling both one-time in-app purchases and recurring subscriptions.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Flexible Payment Processing**: Support for both one-stage (immediate charge) and two-stage payments (authorize and capture later).

## Requirements
*   iOS 16.0+
*   Xcode 14.0+

## Getting Started
1.  **Configure Products**: Set up your paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions in the [Onside Developer Console](https://developer.onside.io). This will allow you to get the product identifiers needed to work with the SDK.
2.  **Integrate the SDK**: `OnsideKit` distributes as a pre-compiled binary framework (`.xcframework`) for fast build times and simple integration. You can add it to your project using Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods, or by manually linking the framework.
